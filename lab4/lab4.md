### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE? 
Licensening can prevent your code being used without permission. It can also help the open source community how they can utilize the code.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license? 

Because a unlicensed usually does not explicitly grant you the right to use its code. The license is also an instruction for developers about how they can use the project. Thus, we the developers shou not use a project without permission and instruction.

### Why the Web beat Gopher. 

Yes. On one hand, the Gopher does not have a large online community so it is harder for its administrator to maintain. On the other hand, the HTML online community is united, and the Gopher community is forked away too often.

### Can you justify why such a license is chosen.

The Apache license is good for organizations because it requires trademarks of the organizations developing the project. It can attract potential developers who would like to join the organization.

### Think of an example project for your Table. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.

Firefox plugin - keeps video tabs on top, adjustable size, gets rid of borders.   
Our project could use the MIT license.

### Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good. You may use tldrlegal.

The best license for developers is GPL The only restriction of GPL is that the modifications of the original project must track with the source code and its original version. Thus, it is provided with the least restriction for developers. LGPL is the best for the common good. It is the most applicable license to libraries because it requires the developers to state significant changes made to the software. Apache/BSD is the best for companies because it requires the inclusion trademarks of the compaines developing the project.

### Create a repository and choose a license.

### Write five sentences about choosing a project to work on in this course, who will be users/customers of such a project, and what license you would choose.
강인원 suggested our group would work on a firefox youtube plugin:  
It keeps video tabs on top with adjustable size. It also gets rid of borders obscuring view.  
It's potential customers will be the firefox users using youtube.  
We would choose the MIT license.
