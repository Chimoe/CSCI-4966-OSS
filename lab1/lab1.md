## Reading Assignments

### OSD: 
The open source software is written for everyone, and it's not written against anyone.

### How to answer the question The Smart Way:
1: Don't boast yourself while answering questions.
2: Be aware of people do not know something you think they should have known when answering their questions.

### Free Culture, Chap 3:
We the generation grew enjoyed the free culture should be aware of the consequence from illegal distribution.
This type of action may be prosecuted, and make us pay a higher price than enjoying content in a lawful way.

But awareness cannot guarantee us safe. 
What Jesse had suffered may happen on anyone of us. 
So, when we perform any action which may not be safe in the American legal system, halt or do it in a system somewhere else. 

If Jesse had his search engine running anonymously on Vietnam, China or Russia in the year of 2019, he will never have to pay any price.

## Reflection

### Open Source Project

A interesting Open Source Project for evaluation need to be innovative and influential. To me, it means that project is designed or used to solve challenging problems.  

In this lab, I chose google flutter, an open-source mobile application development SDK recently came out of beta. It is used to develop applications for Android and iOS, as well as being the primary method of creating applications for Google Fuchsia. 

Flutter can be a good solution to me and the RCOS community. We have many active projects planning to release its mobile app, but it's nearly impossible for project leaders to maintain stable working teams for each of the iOS, Android and Web platform.
